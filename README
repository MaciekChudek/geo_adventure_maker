A web-based interface for making geoadventures (https://github.com/MaciekChudek/geo_adventure) by setting waypoints and logic on a google map.

Currently not working due updates to google maps API. Will update next time I need to make a geoadventure.

Language: Javascript, node.js, meteor framework.

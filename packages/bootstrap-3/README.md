# Meteor Bootstrap Package.

This is a drop-in replacement for meteor's core bootstrap package. It doesn't do anything special, just replaces core.

The idea is that this package should be updated more frequently than core.

Also fixes the white icons bug.

## Usage Example

Have some files like these:

    meteor remove bootstrap
    mrt add bootstrap-updated

## Install

Install with meteorite: https://atmosphere.meteor.com/wtf/app

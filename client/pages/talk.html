	<p class='about_text'> Who: <a href='http://abcs.asu.edu/Maciek'>Maciek Chudek</a></p>
	<p class='about_text'> 
		Why: Initially I just made a tool for making cool birthday adventures for some of my far-flung loved ones. Then I put in <span style='text-decoration:line-through;'>a little</span> a bunch more time making it into something that others could use too, partly as a way of teaching myself some new android and reactive javascript coding techniques. If a lot of people are excited by this and use it, I'll make it open source and throw the code up online.
